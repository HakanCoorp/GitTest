Key words to remember when playing with Subversion & GIT
----------------------------------------­--------------------------------------
1. Master Repository: place where you upload your Committed files.
2. Local Repository: place on your computer where you save and work on files
3. State/Revision: basically a save file of your repository (they never overwrite)
4. Commit: store your files to a state/revision on your local repository . These commits serve as nodes. 
5. Nodes: "save files" of commits to the repository. Nodes automatically Branch off of the Master Repository 
6. Branch: both a verb and a noun, referring how GIT branches off nodes when users commit their files.
7. Head: most recent node on a branch 
8. Merge: Combines 2 branch heads together into 1 branch (usually with the Master Branch)
